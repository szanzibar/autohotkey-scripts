waiting=The (Waiting for Agent) status indicates that a scan object has been created but the agent hasn't yet picked it up. If the computer is Internal then the scan object only exists on the Inventory server. If the computer is Unavailable or External then the scan also exists in the cloud (i.e. on our server). The status will change when an Internal agent picks it up from the Inventory server and starts the scan or an External agent completes the scan and sends the result to the cloud.{enter}If the status hasn't changed for an Internal agent then there should be an error in the event log on the agent computer that would give more information.
stop=Stop deploying to targets once they succeed

req=Thank you for your feedback. I've put this request into our system, but I'm not sure when or even if it will get implemented into a future build.{enter}Let us know if you run into any other problems.
conf=Will you go Help -> Current Configuration Summary in both programs and send us the text files that are generated?
last=This error generally means that the remote process unexpectedly ended or disconnected. This could be due to the computer shutting down or going offline, or from antivirus interfering. Will you check to see if any of those scenarios apply in this case? Are you able to reproduce the problem if you deploy/scan again?
objectold=To troubleshoot this issue, we'll need to see a memory dump. When the error triggered it may have generated a dump file at C:\ProgramData\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory\dumps. If it did, please submit your database and it will include the memory dump automatically. Just run this command in an administrative command prompt:{enter}{enter}If it didn't automatically create a memory dump, please get Inventory to trigger the error again, and then while it is in an errored state, right click on the Inventory console in task manager -> Create dump file. Zip up the file and rename it to [ticketnumber].zip, and upload the file to https://dbinbox.com/adminarsenal. Reply to let us know when that's done.
object=Did this error happen when you reconnected to a disconnected RDP session? If so, it is a known issue. We recommend closing the console before disconnecting, or simply restarting the console should fix it.{enter}If it was something else, can you tell us more about what caused the problem?
repo=Usually packages fail to download due to network connectivity errors to our online repository or permission problems. Please make sure your background service user and Console user have write access to the repository.{enter}Also check to make sure that you have access to the links listed in the external exclusions section of this article:{enter}https://support.pdq.com/hc/en-us/articles/220533627-Windows-Firewall-Ports-and-Exceptions{#}external{space}
dns=Usually this error is due to DNS problems. Can you ping this target machine by hostname and IP? Will you verify that the IP from nslookup HOSTNAME matches the IP that you get from manually running ipconfig on the target machine?
temp=C:\Users\[background service user]\AppData\Local\Temp\PDQDeployService\[PDQDeploy service PID]
supportsite=Our new support site doesn't use the accounts from our old support site. If you create a new account you should be able to get in. Let us know if that doesn't work. 
revision=This error is related to SMB authentication. The error is saying that the SMB connection on the endpoint and the SMB connection from the server do not match versions. Often this is due to something using SMB 1 on the network. For example, if a printer scanned a file to the server or client. SMB sessions get left open, and new sessions with a later SMB version are denied. {enter}We have also seen this error more often recently seemingly for no reason. We're not sure if it's something to do with a recent windows update or a change in the .NET Framework. Unfortunately, since this error originates from .NET, there isn't anything we can do in our product to fix it. Microsoft has this extremely helpful (/S) article on the subject: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms838294.aspx {enter}We'll keep researching this, but in the meantime our best recommendation is to reboot. If that doesn't work, you can look at your SMB sessions and manually close them. Go to Computer Management -> Shared Folders -> Sessions and close sessions from there.
scanning=Will you navigate to C:\Windows\AdminArsenal\PDQInventory-Scanner on the target machine, delete all the log files in that folder, scan again, and send us the new log files that get regenerated?
back1=https://support.pdq.com/knowledge-base/905
back2=Please reset your background service credentials using this guide: https://support.pdq.com/knowledge-base/905{Space}
alogs=We'd like to see some agent logs. Please run the attached powershell script on the target machine and it will gather all agent logs to C:\ProgramData\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory Agent\AgentLogs.zip. Simply attach the zip in your reply.
dev1=So far motivating the developers with daily beatings hasn't yielded the productivity we hoped for. We'll try withholding affection next. As soon as they have this bug squished we'll get you a new build.
dev2=We've gone back to the daily beatings and are making progress getting this fixed. We'll continue to update you with our progress.
dev3=We went back to spurring the developers forward with energy drinks and Cheetos and hope to have a fix soon. We'll let you know.
psevtx=Can you send us some event logs? The attached powershell script will generate an evtx file automatically, or you can do it manually with the instructions here: https://support.pdq.com/knowledge-base/891 Just attach the evtx file in your reply.
test=Test Multiple Addresses in Name Resolution
locked=Usually this is fixed by restarting your console and the background service. Let us know if that doesn't work.
idb=`%programdata`%\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory\database.db
ddb=`%programdata`%\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Deploy\database.db
performance=In Inventory, go to Preferences -> PDQ Deploy and make sure the "Cleanup deployment older than" setting isn't too high. Try 60 days or lower if you can.{enter}In Deploy, go to Preferences -> Deployments -> Cleanup and make sure that's 30 days or lower if possible.{enter}Also in Deploy, check Preferences -> Repository -> See Unused Files and make sure there aren't too many unused files, as that can also negatively impact performance.
license=To work around this error, first uninstall your current build, then install 16.6. Your database and settings will not be removed. Let us know if that works.
movedb=Here are the steps to change the database location:{enter}1. Stop the PDQDeploy/PDQInventory background service{Enter}2. Copy your database from %programdata%\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Deploy\database.db or %programdata%\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory\database.db to the new location{Enter}3. Create a string registry value called FileName at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Deploy\Settings\Database\ or HKLM\SOFTWARE\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory\Settings\Database\{Enter}4. Set the value of FileName to the new path of your database.{Enter}5. Restart Deploy/Inventory, and you should be good to go.

corruption=The most common reasons for database corruption are events such as the computer going to sleep, unexpected shutdowns, large number of endpoints with scan and heartbeat intervals too frequent, too many agents, or interference from external sources such as antivirus software. Do any of these things apply to you?{enter}Can you think of any pattern or trigger that correlates with the database getting corrupt?
adirectory=C:\ProgramData\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory Agent
nettcp=Go to Preferences -> Performance -> Service Manager TCP Connection and set to Disabled. Then restart the console and background service.
proxy=As far as we can tell, everything is working with the package library, although library.pdq.com points to a different IP than it used to. Can you make sure to update any firewalls and proxies to allow the new IP?{Enter}For reference, here's the list of external links you need access to: https://support.pdq.com/knowledge-base/1023{#}external 
timeout=here are some things to try:{enter}Don't use the agent. It was downgraded to beta status while we work on performance problems.{enter}Go to Preferences -> Performance -> Service Manager TCP Connection and set to Disabled. Then restart the console and background service.{enter}Try lowering the concurrent scans setting on that same page.{enter}Try raising your heartbeat interval (Preferences -> Network -> Interval){enter}Try lowering your Auto Cleanup interval (Preferences -> Scanning -> Auto Cleanup{enter}After making these changes, restart the background service and run for at least an hour to see if there are changes. If there is no improvement after that, please send us your Databases by running these commands in an administrative command prompt:

servicemanager=This is a known issue that we're working on. If you restart the PDQDeploy or PDQInventory background services, that should fix it temporarily. (Let us know if it doesn't).{enter}{enter}We'd also be curious to see information about your open SMB sessions. Could you gather some info for us? Choose a computer that consistently gives this error, then on the central server, run this command in powershell 3 times: Get-SMBConnection{enter}- Right before deploying{enter}- During the deployment{enter}- Right after the deployment.{enter}Let us know which target machine you tested, send us the output, and we'd also like to see your database. Please run this command in an administrative command prompt:
hagent=sqlite3.exe "C:\Programdata\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory\database.db" "update Settings SET Value='01:00:00' WHERE Name='AgentHeartbeatInterval'"
