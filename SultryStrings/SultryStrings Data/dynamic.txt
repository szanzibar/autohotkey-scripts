Send, The (Waiting for Agent) status indicates that a scan object has been created but the agent hasn't yet picked it up. If the computer is Internal then the scan object only exists on the Inventory server. If the computer is Unavailable or External then the scan also exists in the cloud (i.e. on our server). The status will change when an Internal agent picks it up from the Inventory server and starts the scan or an External agent completes the scan and sends the result to the cloud.{enter}If the status hasn't changed for an Internal agent then there should be an error in the event log on the agent computer that would give more information.

Send, To troubleshoot this issue, we'll need to see a memory dump. When the error triggered it may have generated a dump file at C:\ProgramData\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Inventory\dumps. If it did, please submit your database and it will include the memory dump automatically. Just run this command in an administrative command prompt:{enter}{enter}If it didn't automatically create a memory dump, please get Inventory to trigger the error again, and then while it is in an errored state, right click on the Inventory console in task manager -> Create dump file. Zip up the file and rename it to [ticketnumber].zip, and upload the file to https://dbinbox.com/adminarsenal. Reply to let us know when that's done.

:*b0:revision::
Gosub, Prestuff
Send, This error is related to SMB authentication. The error is saying that the SMB connection on the endpoint and the SMB connection from the server do not match versions. Often this is due to something using SMB 1 on the network. For example, if a printer scanned a file to the server or client. SMB sessions get left open, and new sessions with a later SMB version are denied. {enter}We have also seen this error more often recently seemingly for no reason. We're not sure if it's something to do with a recent windows update or a change in the .NET Framework. Unfortunately, since this error originates from .NET, there isn't anything we can do in our product to fix it. Microsoft has this extremely helpful (/S) article on the subject: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms838294.aspx {enter}We'll keep researching this, but in the meantime our best recommendation is to reboot. If that doesn't work, you can look at your SMB sessions and manually close them. Go to Computer Management -> Shared Folders -> Sessions and close sessions from there.
