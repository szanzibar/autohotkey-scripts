## SultryStrings

This was a project I made in 2018-2019 to automate the repetitive snippets I found myself writing repeatedly to PDQ customers.

#### To use:

1. `Win+Shift+k` hotkey to bring up main window with list of strings
1. type key/activation string
1. sends the corresponding value string into your active Window

##### Other features

In SultryStrings main window:

- type `em` to edit and view other special hotkeys in VS code
